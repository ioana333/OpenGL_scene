# 3D Graphics Rendering Project using OpenGL

## Description
This project implements a 3D interactive graphics application using OpenGL. The application allows for rendering a 3D scene, with features such as camera movement, automatic camera animations, lighting effects, textures, and shadows. The user can explore the scene manually or watch an automated camera tour. The scene is illuminated with multiple light sources and rendered with realistic textures and materials.

### Features:
- Manual camera movement using WASD and mouse for rotation (yaw/pitch)
- Zoom functionality using the mouse scroll wheel
- Automatic camera animation (camera tour with predefined waypoints)
- Directional and point light sources for dynamic lighting effects
- Shadow mapping for realistic shadows
- Textures and materials applied to objects in the scene
- Skybox rendered at the end of the scene for background

### Controls:
- **W, A, S, D**: Move the camera in the 3D space
- **SPACE, LEFT SHIFT**: Move the camera up/down along the Y-axis
- **Mouse Movement**: Rotate the camera (yaw/pitch)
- **Mouse Scroll**: Zoom in/out (modifies Field of View)
- **P**: Activate automatic camera tour
- **R**: Toggle the rotation of the directional light

## Installation

### Requirements:
- **C++ compiler** (GCC or any compatible)
- **OpenGL** (latest version)
- **GLFW** (for window management and input handling)
- **GLM** (for math operations, especially matrix manipulation)
- **GLEW** (for OpenGL extensions)

### Steps:
1. **Clone the repository**:
2. **Compile the project or open the .exe file alredy in the .zip archive**
